# compose-multiplatform-patterns — Android

Scope: Android variant of the `compose-multiplatform-patterns` skill.
Load when: you are doing `compose-multiplatform-patterns` on Android.

## Context

Kotlin/Compose-first. Android lifecycle (Activity, Service, WorkManager), internal/cache/scoped storage, permission model.
Topic: Compose Multiplatform and Jetpack Compose patterns for KMP projects — state management, navigation, theming, performance, and platform-specific UI. Use when building Compose or Jetpack Compose UI, state, navigation, or theming in a KMP project.

## Scripting

Shell + ADB; `./gradlew assembleDebug`, `adb install`, `logcat`, `adb shell dumpsys`. Pitfalls: Doze/App Standby background limits, emulator-vs-device drift, scoped-storage restrictions.

## Pitfalls

- Adapt the base skill's generic steps to the OS commands above.
- Verify in a shell loop before committing OS-specific chunks.

## Notes

- Base skill: SKILL.md (topic instructions, OS-agnostic).
- Generated variant; hand-tune after first task use.
