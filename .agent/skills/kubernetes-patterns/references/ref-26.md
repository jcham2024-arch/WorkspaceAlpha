```
```yaml
# BAD: Using :latest tag — non-deterministic deployments
image: myapp:latest

# GOOD: Pin to a specific immutable tag (SHA or semver)
image: ghcr.io/org/myapp:1.4.2
# or
image: ghcr.io/org/myapp@sha256:abc123...

# ---

# BAD: Running as root
securityContext: {}    # Defaults to root

# GOOD: Non-root with explicit UID
securityContext:
  runAsNonRoot: true
  runAsUser: 1001

# ---

# BAD: No resource limits — one pod can starve the entire node
containers:
  - name: app
    image: myapp:1.0.0
    # No resources defined

# GOOD: Always set requests and limits
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: "100m"
    memory: "128Mi"
  limits:
    cpu: "500m"
    memory: "256Mi"

# ---

# BAD: Storing plaintext secrets in ConfigMaps
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
data:
  DB_PASSWORD: "mysecretpassword"   # NEVER — use Secret or external secrets manager

# ---

# BAD: ClusterAdmin for application service accounts
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: cluster-admin    # Grants god-mode to your app

# ---

# BAD: minAvailable: 0 in PDB — defeats the purpose
spec:
  minAvailable: 0

# ---

# BAD: restartPolicy: Always in a Job (causes infinite restart loop)
spec:
  restartPolicy: Always   # Use OnFailure or Never for Jobs
```

```
