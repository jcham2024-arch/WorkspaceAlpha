# Kubernetes Patterns

Production-grade Kubernetes patterns for deploying, managing, and debugging workloads reliably.

## When to Activate

- Writing Kubernetes manifests (Deployments, Services, Ingress, Jobs)
- Configuring resource requests/limits, liveness/readiness probes
- Setting up RBAC, namespaces, or ServiceAccounts
- Managing configuration and secrets in K8s
- Debugging CrashLoopBackOff, OOMKilled, pending pods, or image pull errors
- Configuring HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) or PodDisruptionBudgets
- Reviewing K8s YAML for security or correctness

## When to Use

> Same as **When to Activate** above. This alias satisfies repo skill-format conventions. Use this skill any time you are writing, reviewing, or debugging Kubernetes YAML and workloads.

## How It Works

This skill provides **copy-pasteable, production-grade YAML patterns** and **kubectl debugging commands** organized by task:

1. **Deployment template** — A fully configured production `Deployment` with security context, rolling update strategy, all three probe types, resource limits, and environment injection from ConfigMap/Secret.
2. **Probes** — Decision table for startup vs liveness vs readiness, with correct `failureThreshold × periodSeconds` math.
3. **Services & Ingress** — ClusterIP, LoadBalancer, and TLS Ingress patterns with cert-manager annotations.
4. **ConfigMaps & Secrets** — `envFrom`, file-mount, and external secrets guidance.
5. **Resource management** — Requests vs limits rules of thumb by workload type (web API, JVM, worker, sidecar).
6. **RBAC** — Least-privilege ServiceAccount → Role → RoleBinding chain.
7. **HPA & PDB** — Autoscaling and node-drain safety configurations.
8. **Jobs & CronJobs** — One-off and scheduled workload patterns with correct `restartPolicy`.
9. **kubectl cheatsheet** — Logs, exec, rollback, port-forward, dry-run, and common error diagnosis commands.
10. **Anti-patterns & checklist** — What NOT to do, and a security/reliability/observability checklist.

## Core Workload Patterns

### Deployment — Production Template


---

## Probes — Liveness, Readiness, Startup

Understanding when to use each probe is critical:

| Probe | Failure Action | Use For |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| `startupProbe` | Kills container if slow to start | Slow-starting apps (JVM, Python) |
| `livenessProbe` | Restarts container | Deadlock / hung process detection |
| `readinessProbe` | Removes from Service endpoints | Temporary unavailability (DB reconnect) |



---

## Services and Ingress

### Service Types



### Ingress with TLS


---

## ConfigMaps and Secrets

### ConfigMap — Non-sensitive configuration



### Secrets — Sensitive data



> **Important:** Raw Kubernetes Secrets are only base64-encoded, not encrypted at rest unless your cluster has encryption configured. Use [Sealed Secrets](https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets) or [External Secrets Operator](https://external-secrets.io) for production.

---

## Resource Requests and Limits


**Rules of thumb:**

| Workload Type | CPU Request | Memory Request | Notes |
|---------------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| Web API | 100–250m | 128–256Mi | Set limits 2-4x requests |
| Worker/consumer | 250–500m | 256–512Mi | Memory limit = request for predictability |
| JVM app | 500m–1 | 512Mi–2Gi | Allow headroom above `-Xmx` for JVM overhead |
| Sidecar | 10–50m | 32–64Mi | Keep minimal |


---

## RBAC — Roles and ServiceAccounts

### Principle of Least Privilege

**Two patterns depending on whether the app calls the Kubernetes API:**

#### Pattern A — App does NOT need the Kubernetes API (most apps)

Disable token automounting on the ServiceAccount. The Role/RoleBinding are not needed.



#### Pattern B — App DOES need the Kubernetes API (operators, controllers, config watchers)

Enable the token and grant only the permissions actually required.





---

## Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)


> HPA requires `resources.requests` to be set on all containers — it calculates utilization as `current / request`.

---

## PodDisruptionBudget (PDB)

Prevent too many pods going down during node drains or rolling updates:


---

## Namespaces and Multi-Tenancy


---

## Jobs and CronJobs



---

## kubectl Debugging Cheatsheet


### Diagnosing Common Errors


---

## Anti-Patterns

## Best Practices Checklist

### Security
- [ ] Container runs as non-root (`runAsNonRoot: true`, `runAsUser` set)
- [ ] `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true` with `emptyDir` for writable paths
- [ ] `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false`
- [ ] All capabilities dropped (`capabilities.drop: [ALL]`)
- [ ] Dedicated ServiceAccount per app, not `default`
- [ ] `automountServiceAccountToken: false` unless needed
- [ ] RBAC follows least privilege (use `Role`, not `ClusterRole` unless needed)
- [ ] Secrets managed via Sealed Secrets or External Secrets Operator

### Reliability
- [ ] All 3 probe types configured (startup + liveness + readiness)
- [ ] Resource requests AND limits set on every container
- [ ] `minReplicas: 2+` for any production workload
- [ ] PodDisruptionBudget defined for stateful or critical services
- [ ] `RollingUpdate` strategy with `maxUnavailable: 0`
- [ ] HPA configured for variable-load services

### Observability
- [ ] App exposes `/health` (liveness) and `/ready` (readiness) endpoints
- [ ] Structured JSON logging (no PII in logs)
- [ ] Resource labels: `app`, `version`, `environment`
