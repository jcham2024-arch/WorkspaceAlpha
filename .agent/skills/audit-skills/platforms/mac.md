# audit-skills — Mac

Scope: Mac variant of the `audit-skills` skill.
Load when: you are doing `audit-skills` on Mac.

## Context

POSIX base + Apple extensions (Frameworks, Keychain, Gatekeeper, Xcode); zsh default; Homebrew prefixes.
Topic: Expert security auditor for AI Skills and Bundles. Performs non-intrusive static analysis to identify malicious patterns, data leaks, system stability risks, and obfuscated payloads across Windows, macOS, Linux/Unix, and Mobile (Android/iOS).

## Scripting

zsh scripts; `brew install`, `brew services` for daemons; `osascript` for GUI tasks. Pitfalls: Gatekeeper quarantine (`xattr -d com.apple.quarantine`), arm64 vs Intel, code-signing/notarization.

## Pitfalls

- Adapt the base skill's generic steps to the OS commands above.
- Verify in a shell loop before committing OS-specific chunks.

## Notes

- Base skill: SKILL.md (topic instructions, OS-agnostic).
- Generated variant; hand-tune after first task use.
