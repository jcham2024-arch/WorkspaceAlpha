# Three.js Skills

Systematically create high-quality 3D scenes and interactive experiences using Three.js best practices.

## Detailed Guide

Read [the detailed guide](references/detailed-guide.md) before executing this skill. It retains the complete procedure and reference material. Treat its safety, prerequisites, and validation requirements as mandatory. For focused work, load the relevant sections; for end-to-end work, read the guide completely.

## When to Use
- Requests 3D visualizations or graphics ("create a 3D model", "show in 3D")
- Wants interactive 3D experiences ("rotating cube", "explorable scene")
- Needs WebGL or canvas-based rendering
- Asks for animations, particles, or visual effects
- Mentions Three.js, WebGL, or 3D rendering
- Wants to visualize data in 3D space

## Example Workflow

User: "Create an interactive 3D sphere that responds to mouse movement"

1. **Setup**: Import Three.js, create scene/camera/renderer
2. **Geometry**: Create `SphereGeometry(1, 32, 32)` for smooth sphere
3. **Material**: Use `MeshStandardMaterial` for realistic look
4. **Lighting**: Add ambient + directional lights
5. **Interaction**: Track mouse position, update camera
6. **Animation**: Rotate sphere, render continuously
7. **Responsive**: Add window resize handler
8. **Result**: Smooth, interactive 3D sphere ✓

## Limitations
- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.
