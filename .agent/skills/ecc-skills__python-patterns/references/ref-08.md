# Good: Catch specific exceptions
def load_config(path: str) -> Config:
    try:
        with open(path) as f:
            return Config.from_json(f.read())
    except FileNotFoundError as e:
        raise ConfigError(f"Config file not found: {path}") from e
    except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
        raise ConfigError(f"Invalid JSON in config: {path}") from e

# Bad: Bare except
def load_config(path: str) -> Config:
    try:
        with open(path) as f:
            return Config.from_json(f.read())
    except:
        return None  # Silent failure!
